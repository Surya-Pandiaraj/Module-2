# Built-in Functions -Binary Conversion Using Built-in Functions in Python

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program to convert the number **16** into its **binary representation** using built-in Python functions.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Assign the value `16` to a variable `a`.
2. Use the built-in `bin()` function to convert the number to binary.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
a=16
print("The binary representation for sixteen is")
print(bin(a))
```

## Output
![438898688-c9aacbe6-5f3e-4a01-a5a2-8b5e1dad5095](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/086045df-0555-42b9-bfc7-5a87f419e5a9)


## Result
Hence the program executed successfully!
